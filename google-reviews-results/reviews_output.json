The garlic bread was good and the dipping sauce was a nice touch.\n\nPizza came fairly quickly.  A standard deep dish with sausage, onion and pepper.  Good crust, good flavor for sauce and toppings were perfect.\n\nService was quick and attentive.  A great experience.",

I went with a large pizza (though I initially wanted a medium, but no big deal), some wings (skip), and a Caesar salad (also skip). Then, the much-anticipated pizza arrived.\n\nYes, the pepperoni was nicely toasted, and yes, the crust was crisp and crunchy. But for me, it didn‚Äôt hit the flavor notes I was hoping for. It didn‚Äôt leave me thinking, ‚ÄúWow, I can‚Äôt wait to come back!‚Äù\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high, or perhaps I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about when it comes to Chicago pizza.\n\nBut for me, Pequod‚Äôs didn‚Äôt live up to the hype.\n\nApologies, Chicagoans. üòî",

The pizza crust was burnt, but that could be due to my requesting the pizza to be well done. However, Pequod‚Äôs needs to do some serious pest control. I caught, using a napkin, a roach climbing the wall next to our table. And my daughter has a dead one on the table next to her plate. The staff comped us a pizza. Thanks. But please do pest control immediately. I have come away with mixed feelings. Considering the hoops I had to go through to get a table, it‚Äôs not worth it. But, will I go back and give them a second chance? Yes, but only after post control.",

They let you personalize them with your toppings, which was great since everyone at the table was all over the place with topping desires. We also got an order of fries (crispy, delicious) and the house salad (super basic but surprisingly good). I got an Arnold Palmer to drink. We made a reservation online ahead of time because we heard it gets busy and the line gets long. They seated us right away upstairs. We ordered with the QR code on our table and also the server who was bopping by regularly enough. They had some sports games on the TV and it was quite loud upstairs with people chatting and some music playing - this is just something to note if you‚Äôre looking for a place super quiet and intimate! The prices were totally reasonable and the quality of the pizza was good. The sauce was a little more herby than other deep dish recipes in the city. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of deep dish so will probably try the thin crust next time. Will be back when the time is right.",

We ordered a regular deep dish and thin crust cheese pizza; both were good and tasted very fresh! Nonetheless, I‚Äôve had better of both types of pizza at other locations.

        "text": "I‚Äôve heard that Pequad‚Äôs was the best deep dish in Chicago, so I took a detour on a trip I was on recently to try it out. I was there for lunch on the Monday after Christmas, so take that into account for level of busyness and service.\nI arrived around 11:30, and was able to sit down immediately at the bar. I was there alone, so a group might take longer to sit. I did notice that it got significantly more busy as it got closer to noon, and when I left there was a line.\nWalking in, the hostess and GM were very friendly and sat me right away after asking if I was ok sitting at the bar. The bartender was very friendly, and took my order rather than making me go through the online ordering system they have in place. She was also very responsive to any requests for drink refills, check, etc.\nThe food was good, but I was expecting a little better for it being considered the best in Chicago. I had a pan pizza. The edges were crispy, sort of like a Jets pizza, if you are familiar with Detroit Pan Pizza. The sauce and cheese were about what I expect from a handmade pizza place. I did notice that the cheese texture seemed to be better on the second slice, so maybe let the pizza rest a little when they bring it to your table.\nTwo slices were more than enough for me on my 10‚Äù pan pizza, figure that it is about the same amount of food as three or even four slices of a large pizza from elsewhere. I took the rest home, and it was very good the second, third, and fourth time I ate it.\nParking was a little difficult, but I was able to find a spot in the residential neighborhood behind the restaurant and walked a bit. I don‚Äôt know if was supposed to pay or not, but I didn‚Äôt see any signs, meters, or painted curbs to suggest that I was not supposed to park there.\nI don‚Äôt know if I would go terribly far out of my way to visit, but for me it was only about 30 minutes more of driving, so I am glad I had the experience.",

We ordered mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, half caesar salad, cheesy garlic bread, and a 14'' pie with mushrooms and Italian sausage along with some drinks. It was plenty of food, and we ended up having some deep dish leftover. You order via QR code, so you're really only seeing the wait staff when they drop off your food/drinks. Deep dish was delicious and very filling though I'm personally still a bigger fan of thin crust pizza. Everyone was also big fans of the mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers as well.",

        "text": "TL;DR - Long wait but decent pizza!\n\nFood:\n- Deep dish pizza: The pizza has a decent sauce though I find it a bit under-seasoned. Either way, I think it's pretty good. The only criticism I have is that more oil should be used in the pan for a crispier bottom of the crust. The dough was fully cooked but it lacked the expected crispiness--though this does not mean that it's a consistent issue. It could just have been due to them being very busy because of the race.\n\nI liked this place. Just keep in mind that it takes about 45 mins for a deep dish to be cooked. So, while you'll wait for a while for the food, that's just the nature of a deep dish. Don't be rude to the staff because of this.",

I was pretty full from my lunch but powered through to try this Chicago staple. I got a personal pizza with black olives, sausage, meatballs, extra cheese and fresh basil. I could only eat half of pizza but every bite was just like a little party. All of the flavors and the dough come together in such a great way. Now I will say it‚Äôs messy and I would advise you eat it with a knife and fork. The service was attentive and helpful and there was lots of places to sit and I didn‚Äôt have to wait. But went pretty early on a snowy Monday. The pizza is pretty hot when it arrives so be patient and let it cool down. Also I think each pizza takes about 30 minutes to make so be patient when you go.",

        "text": "Had to try was everyone called the \"best deep dish\" in Chicago. For the record id tried giardiano's and lou malnati's previously and I have to agree with the public-- Pequod's is the best! The sauce is saucy with the texture of crush tomatoes but not tangy like some pizza sauces are. It was seasoned well. The crust was caramelized and the texture was perfect. I think what sets this deep dish apart is how well the crust holds up with the toppings. Often the deep dish experience means that the integrity of the crust is compromised by the weight of all the ingredients and the sauce but this crust was deliciously solid and hd everything together well, making it the perfect bite of deep dish deliciousness.\n\nThe service was amazing and our server was so sweet. I didn't make a reservation prior which I didnt know you had to do but they accommodates us upstairs. There is a nice selection of local beers and we had the Maple Son of Juice.\n\nThe pizzas take about 40 minutes but it's definitely worth it. We ordered a salad and wings and they were brought out prior. The salad was fresh and crisp with an amazing dressing and the wings were crispy and not overly sauced.\n\nWe opted for a personal pan pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Well aware that's it's for one person but to be honest this pizza is so filling! I have no idea how people can eat a whole pie but our server said she's seen people house a whole deep dish pizza on their own!

Honestly, I'm so glad they're open later than most typical pizza joints in the city. We ordered a deep dish with sausage, peperoni, and mushrooms. The crust was delicious, nice and crispy, but some parts were black very burnt. Ehhhh, 4/5 on the crust. The sausage was disappointing, to say the least. It was more like gigantic meatballs 2/5 for the toppings. The peperoni and mushrooms were fabulous, tho. Perfect amout of sauce. Next time, I'll get extra cheese, but it was still good. The inside looked bomb.com when we drove past. I'm definitely eating in-house next time. All in all, I definitely recommend this establishment, give em all your money. Can't wait to go back!",

My friend and I shared a small pepperoni pizza, with half garlic and basil and the other half pepper and onions. The marinara sauce was amazing and the toppings were plentiful but the actual pizza crust did not taste like anything except for the caramelized edge, which is sad given that the crust makes up so much of the pizza and the bottom pizza crust (beneath the soft thick crust) tasted and had the consistency of plain crispy toast. Overall, Pequod's has the warm feel of a mom and pop shop, the service was great and I am glad they were able to squeeze us in at the bar on a saturday night, but I‚Äôm not in a hurry to go back.",

The host saw he was handicap and there were tables on main floor that. He could have given us but no took is upstairs! Sadly host doesn't think outside the box! Deep dish Pizza was delicious it takes approximately 45 minutes to make one large. EXTRA TOPPINGS ARE EXPENSIVE be sure to ASK the charge B4 as we added 3 extra almost as much as Pizza itself!!!",

Of note, place is super popular so I would suggest to reserve  your table in advance and take into account with your booking time reservation that probably you will have to wait an additional 30 mins to get the table. That was our experience on a Monday evening.",

        "text": "Chicago visitors and locals alike know the allure of deep dish pizza and the rivalries between the local pizzerias. Pequod's sits in the thick of the conversation. For me, Pequod's is good ‚Äì but not great ‚Äì among all the best-known options out there today. The cheese pulls were great. The charred crust was unique and added texture. But the sauce is what held this pizza back. The strongest flavor was tomato paste, and it was a bit dry relative to the rest of the pie. It could've used a bit more flavor as well ‚Äì maybe a fat or an acid, not a spice. Don't let my critique steer you away, though. Pequod's is still good pizza and worth the visit! At the very least they're a great local option if you're open to trying a new spot for deep dish",

We sat on the second floor which was fine, I was a bit surprised that Friday at 11:40 I was asked if we had a reservation.   When we left and there was a line out the door I understood why.  The pan pizza was OK, reminded me of Pizza Hut breadsticks covered in sauce and cheese.  (Judge me however you want, I like Pizza Hut breadsticks)  Our small pizza took about 40 mins to come out, which our server told us about ahead of time.

A friend  who , between the 2 of us have eaten at enough restaurants that together could have paid off a mortgage on a  small home, highly recommend Pequod's Pizza.\n\nWell with my first bite the excitement vanished! What a disappointment!\nFirst I noticed that the sauce lacked flavor .\nI commented to my wife that\" this sauce is flat, it needs spices.\"\n\nI have been reading a lot if reviews  about the \"caramelized crust\" If you are a fan of burnt cheese, then by all means give the place rave reviews. I would not call this cheese caramelized. The burnt cheese is bitter and changes the flavor of the pizza making it taste, well? Burnt! I had to remove the burnt edges to eat the pizza.\nThe dough to cheese ratio was good and the taste was average at best.\nWe ordered a sausage and mushroom deep dish. Although there was enough sausage and mushrooms the size of the sausage was too large to enjoy without having to be cut into smaller pieces.  Personally I think that sausage pieces  should be  the diameter of a  penny but no larger than a nickel.  These chunks were the size of fork prongs and could have easily been divided into 4 or 5 bite sized pieces.\nThe flavor of the sausage was okay, but certainly not the best I've tasted.\nI can't believe that people rate this the best pan pizza in Chicago. This is not the best that Chicago has to offer. There are many deep dish pizza restaurants in Chicago that offer a better product. Try as many as you can.\nNow that I have tried it I won‚Äôt be returning. I prefer Labriola deep dish.\nBuon appetito",

But I was surprised by how much soul and personality preserved at this place‚ÄîI can imagine it‚Äôs like if your childhood friend went and became famous but still remained the same.\n\nIt‚Äôs my first time visiting Chicago and I HAD to go try the pizza, even if by myself. It was an easy menu and you choose what goes on your pizza‚Äîafter around a 30-minute wait (pizzas are made to order so they‚Äôre hot and fresh and ready to go!!)‚ÄîI finally had it! The crust is reminiscent of a soft bubbly bread with the crunch of cheese (you can see it in the pictures!). The pizza is easy, no-frills, and delicious; I can see why it gets great rep.\n\nPizza is best shared with others but Pequod‚Äôs held space for a solo diner like me to enjoy what‚Äôs meant for everyone‚Äîa vibrant community gathered around great food. So excited to visit Chicago and have this again! (It‚Äôs so easy to book a reservation too! This pizza is best enjoyed fresh!)\n\nPS While commuting here is possible, you may want to take an Uber instead. The walk going here is doable but you can tell it‚Äôs a more car-centric area.",

The website doesn't list \"deep dish\", so i ordered \"pan\" figuring it would get me what I wanted. (Normally I'd order over the phone, but you can't get through and I decided to roll the dice on making an online order, assuming I'd get something good.) Big mistake. This pizza was very disappointing: almost all made up of bland, bready dough with a tiny layer of cheese. 2 stars instead of 1 because the sausage was a nice topping, but I have eaten \"Chicago pizza\" in many places and this was nowhere close to the best and did not live up to its reputation.",

So delicious. 10/10 would do again.",

They have a unique way of cooking their pizzas where they melt the cheese all over the top and halfway down the crust so it looks burnt.  The crust is very thick and tasty, but the homemade sausage is definitely the best part of the pizza.  I was very hungry and forgot to take a picture but here is one slice. LOL",

        "text": "Good pizza, Good Atmosphere, Bad chicken wings.\n\nDefinitely an authentic deep dish pizza here but not the best I've had in the Chicago area. If you're coming as a casual diner and not a food snob, you will probably be thrilled with it, ESPECIALLY the larger pizzas! The personal pizza was plenty enough for me but I think I would've gotten a much better cheese pull from a larger size. Problem is, I went solo and didn't have anyone to share a larger one with, probably good to go here with a group! But if you're solo like me, it's worth a shot anyway.\n\nThe chicken wings were about 70% breading and 30% meat. Definitely not my style, but oh well, you never really know how a restaurant is going to style their wings. Kind of a waste of $15 though sadly. Heads up on the BBQ sauce, it is kind of thick and fairly viscous.\n\nWhat really makes Pequods for me is the atmosphere. In an era where classic Americana feels to be dying, Pequods feels like a quintessential American townie local experience. Back before the internet and tourism became so widespread, I could see this place being a spot that only the locals knew. But it still has some of that kind of vibe.\n\nFrom the ambience of the restaurant to the bartenders and servers, to the runners and bar backs watching snippets of the local college football game and reacting, it feels like a mom&pop pizza restaurant. Although it wasn't my favorite, the pizza was still good and I think this is a small business that deserves support. Give this place a shot and you might like it! I just don't recommend the wings.\n\nRandom footnotes:\nThe staff was very attentive, the bartender kept a close eye on my water and it was kept constantly filled, which I did appreciate. And the playlist or radio station they played in the restaurant was a very good mix of 90s-2000s music. This place does kind of feel like it's frozen in time, which I really liked as someone who was born in the 90s.",

We ordered three large pizzas: one cheese, one pepperoni, and one sausage, and each one was perfect in its own way. The cheese pizza was simple but so satisfying, with that signature caramelized crust that Pequod‚Äôs is known for. The pepperoni had just the right amount of crisp on the edges, and the sausage pizza was a flavor bomb‚Äîthe sausage was juicy and paired perfectly with the rich sauce.\n\nThis place knows how to do deep-dish right, and with three large pizzas, we definitely left stuffed. The vibe inside is laid-back and cozy, and even though it gets busy, the wait is worth it. If you‚Äôre craving true Chicago-style pizza, Pequod's has got to be on your list!",

Being a Chicagoan born and raised I know a thing or two about deep dish pizza. Is it the best deep dish I‚Äôve ever had?? Absolutely not!!! On a scale of 1-10 I‚Äôll give this pizza a 9.5.. the burnt crust on the outer edge sent me over the moon.. very delicious and it was ready for pick up sooner than they said.. I‚Äôll be back again.. soon.. thanks so much",

I got a pie to go, half mosticoli and half ravioli.  45 bucks. I get to the lake and got into the pie. The burnt top crust wasn't pleasing. So I cut it and eat it, if that's the best in chi town, wow. Sad. 45 should've been 25 at max. Overrated. It was good but the pasta was basically frozen lean cuisine at rape you prices. The service was slow. Cut the price in half and it'd be good. It wasn't bad but if this is the best in town, I'm Sad.",

        "text": "I do believe that pea quad is the best Chicago pizza that I‚Äôve had in Chicago. This is coming from someone who has also tried Lum Malnati‚Äòs, Giordano‚Äòs, pizzeria Uno, Gino‚Äôs East, etc.\n\nThis spot does pizza correctly. The deep dish does not come out watery at all, like some other spots, and they somehow can get a caramelized/crispy crust. Without a doubt, the best crust there is.\n\nI also like how they put their toppings on top. This allows for the vegetables or meat to also get a little crispy, rather than staying mushy when placed under the cheese and sauce.\n\nI personally would not get any appetizers. None of their appetizers are fresh, and the pizza bread that they do tastes like Bagel Bites. Just ordered the pizza as soon as you sit down and be prepared to wait about 45 minutes.\n\nService is very OK. They are not that attentive at all, and will forget about bringing other food that you ordered the sides of the pizza.\n\nAtmosphere is not great. Very dim and dark.\n\nMake sure that you get a reservation many days in advance. If you want to come at the time you would like. They have a strict 10 minutes policy before they cancel your reservation. You must make sure to check in early, but also be prepared for waiting an extra 20 to 30 minutes before your table is actually ready\n\nOverall incredible experience when it comes to food. Service was very average, atmosphere definitely could be improved.",

So we ordered their best seller Caramelized Crust deep dish Pan pizza.\nBy the way, The place was cool  although the receptionist placed us on the 2nd floor and the table closer to entrance, that made some people bumped into us while they were walking  , it's better to have a reservation before you go to this place because there's a lot of people lined up and want to try this place. We got curious too that's why we came , and we would like to try it too. I ordered half cheese, half Italian beef Large deep dish Pan pizza. I ordered Large so we could bring home some left over. On our pizza the tomato sauce overpowered everything! It made the taste of our pizza too sour from the tomato sauce, the Italian beef pizza has the same taste, too much tomato sauce, less cheese, and too much of thick porous bread. I could taste the tomato sauce and the porous bread more than the cheese and Italian beef. I don't like it, not my style of deep dish pizza. We enjoyed the cheesy garlic bread! The service was good. The food was ok, the atmosphere was lively and fun.. üòä",

Got extra cheese and giardinera and I feel like I could've even got more cheese with how thick the crust is. The caramelized cheese on the sides is delicious and I kind of wish they could do that on the bottom of the pizza.\n\nGot only a 12\" for myself expecting to have leftovers, and it lasted about 3 days total- this is a lot of food. Great out of the air fryer after time in the fridge.\n\nNot sure how I'd say this compares to other Chicago deep dish, but it was definitely very very very good.\n\nKind of challenging to get a flattering picture.

We ordered a small pizza, and that was perfect for two people. Pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and basil were the toppings on our pizza. Our server did tell us that it would take about 45 minutes for the pizza to come out.  As we were waiting,  our hunger kicked in so that when the pizza came out, we were ready.  The pizza itself is just amazing. From the outer crispy edges to the wonderful combination of flavors from the toppings and the cheese.  This satisfied my deep dish craving for the year.",

Me and my brothers took a vacation to Chicago and this spot was on our list of places to get food from and they did NOT disappoint.\nThe pizza was ABSOLUTELY the best part and the service was excellent! The place was packed but we still found a spot. Quite a snug fit as well so if you‚Äôre on the heavier side I‚Äôd suggest getting a table and not a booth.\nYou can make reservations and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd recommend doing as it can get pretty busy and it can stay busy for a long time.\nThere are no service ramps for anyone who is disabled but it‚Äôs still worth going in and trying or at least getting takeout.\nParking is also pretty rough so get there at a reasonable time to scope out a spot.",

The crust was buttery and crispy. The mozzarella cheese was cooked to perfection at the bottom. A medium pan is enough unless you're a big eater or starving.

Yes Gino's East is also good but if I had to choose one place it is this place and it is out of the way if you are staying downtown Chicago.  But well worth the trip.  It is huge place with an upstairs but expect a long wait if you haven't reserved a table.",

I am talking carmelized crust, sticking to the side of the pan, need an extra utensil just to get it onto your plate, cheese running everywhere, kinda special pizza! Shhh... don't tell anyone... but this may be my favorite pizza in Chicago! Ok... tell anyone you want, but you're gonna want to try this place! And you need to eat in the restaurant! You can not beat the service in this place or the hustle as they rush by with giant pans of sizzling hot pizza straight out of the oven! It is truly fun to see! One of our kids ordered a \"thin\" crust, and I am telling you... that is like a regular hand tossed you get at other places... still good! And definitely get sausage on your pie... it is so good here! Such friendly service and a good selection of beers. If you're not into pizza, they do have some pasta choices as well. Plan on taking home leftovers because one or two slices is more than enough per person! You will love it here!",

With the right ratio of sauce and cheese, you still get a filling and decadent experience without it being sloppy or wet. The caramelized crust was buttery with just the right amount of crisp. We split the appetizer sampler (onion rings, cheese sticks, fried zucchini, and jalape√±o poppers) to tide us over before the pizza came (45 min wait told to us upfront by our kind waiter) and it was delicious!

The sausage, mushroom, and tomato combo was very flavorful. The personal pizza was perfect for a dinner without leftovers. As with other deep dish pizzas (especially if you want that delicious extra well-done crust), expect a relatively long wait at the table. Although the place has facilitated electronic ordering at the table, service can be lacking at dinner time given the restaurant's popularity. Good (though a bit overpriced) selection of beers.",

However, the service experience left much to be desired. On a day when the restaurant was fairly busy, with about three-quarters of the seats filled, there seemed to be only two servers attending to guests. It took an unusually long time‚Äîapproximately 25 minutes‚Äîfor our drink orders to be taken, and by that point, we were ready to order our entire meal. Our appetizers were initially overlooked, which the staff apologized for, and oddly, our pizzas arrived before the starters. After placing our order, our server became virtually invisible, necessitating communication through the food runner for any needs. Our server reemerged only when we were seeking to pay the bill, having been absent for check-ins or refill offers throughout our meal.\n\nDespite the service challenges, the quality of the pizza compels me to consider returning. Should the service improve on a future visit, I am open to revising my review.",

The other toppings were great as well (mushrooms, pepperoni, olive and jalape√±os, for nice spicy kick)! The crust, was awesome and had a crispy cheesy edge that was just phenomenal. The pie itself was loaded with wonderful string mozzarella, as well as toppings! The pizza gets 5 stars hands down.\nWe also got a couple appetizers, the wings and mozzarella sticks. The wings were pretty standard breaded wings. The Buffalo sauce was super tasty though. The mozzarella sticks were good but nothing super special.\nThe beer selection, while small, had some very good options that went magnificently with the food.\nIt was a little noisy, but the service was great.\nWould definitely go again!",

Customer service was direct but pleasant as well.\nCall ahead if you want to eat in, or you can take it to go. They even ship!\nI‚Äôm so glad I ordered enough to take leftovers home.",

I went in with expectations relatively high - understandably.\n\nOrdered cheesy garlic bread - it was okay, nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about.\n\nLarge sausage pan pizza.  This is where things went south.  First bite in and all we tasted was charcoal.  Flipped the pizza over and it was not just black but blackened to ash making the crust completely inedible.\n\nHaving been our first time there, I actually asked the waitress if this was supposed to be this way, I knew they were mowed for blackened edges.  She saw and even said it‚Äôs not supposed to look like that and made a comment that whoever was in the kitchen isn‚Äôt very good.  She gave us a discount on our pizza but in truth, I think it should have been fully taken off the bill.  To even spend $20 on a pizza that none of us could (not a choice, it was not edible) eat (my kids love pizza and none would touch it) in my opinion is wrong.\n\nI‚Äôd like to try the pizza again, maybe it was a fluke but if you get burnt pizza, my suggestion is to ask for it off the bill all together - you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for something so terrible.",

We ordered online and that changed to a 75 min wait. We came back at the appropriate time and the pick up staff had no idea what was going on. They said the kitchens were behind and had no idea when our order would be available. We ended up waiting over 2hrs for our pizza along with a handful of others. Some people had their pizzas come out an hour apart...\n\nThe pick up staff couldn't tell us if our pizza was in the oven or being made now. There was no communication between the pick up location and kitchen. Completely disorganized...\n\nWe had much better experiences at different pizza joints than this one... Don't even bother...",

The caramelized cheese crust is delicious and the ingredients are all good, but it didn't wow me.\nMaybe a little nitpicky, but the tavern pizza isn't as crispy as I would like, and the deep dish is very bready and somewhat bland. I recommend ordering extra cheese and extra sauce to make up for how bready their pie is. Overall, it's tasty, but not my favorite Chicago pizza place.\nThe atmosphere here is fantastic, though. It's not a touristy cafeteria vibe like a lot of famous deep dish locations. It's more of a rowdy tavern vibe, and the place is packed full of people all having a great time. They also have a great lunch special of a personal cheese pie for 8 bucks.\nThis is a good place to bring a large party and also great for children. Make sure you have a reservation, this place is always packed.",

We figured we would try it when we were in Chicago on our vacation. We are from Ottawa, Ont. We were very disappointed in the food. I definitely prefer the deep dish pizza's in Ottawa. The dough didn't have much flavor. They used spaghetti sauce instead of a pizza sauce. It was very greasy and it was quite burnt. We also got there cheesy garlic bread. We couldn't taste any garlic and it came with what appeared to be a tomato sauce with oil. I got myself there apple caramel cheese cake. That was good although it was really small for $7.95usd. Had our air b&b not been 35 minutes away we would have brought it back. The service was good. Friendly staff. It has a pub feel to it when you walk in.",

Unlike any other, it boasts a burnt caramelized flavor that elevates each bite to a whole new level of indulgence.\n\nNow, onto the toppings. While the pizza itself is undeniably delicious, the toppings are priced at a premium. Despite their quality, the hefty price tag may deter some pizza aficionados from fully indulging in their favorite combinations.\n\nI have also tried their wings which have a texture that's simply unparalleled and flavors that dance on your taste buds, these wings are a must-try accompaniment to your pizza feast. Although would have been great if they bought wings first rather than pizza.\n\nHowever, Here lies the Achilles' heel of Pan Pizza. With staff seemingly in a perpetual hurry, the lack of attention to customer needs leaves much to be desired. Forget about refills or checking in on your dining experience; it's a hit-or-miss affair.",

Street parking is available via the meter, and then it's free after 8PM. The pan pizza is the best with pepperoni and sausage. The Pepsi they get from the machines is probably the best I have tasted (not watered down). I took my family here and we very much enjoyed it. Just be patient with waiting to be seated and be patient with the cooking of the pizza.",

I was rather disappointed that I had bragged about this place for so damn long. The hype has destroyed this place IMO. The service still SUCKED, everyone that works here acts like they are so above everyone. They have nasty attitudes and just don‚Äôt GAF. The women‚Äôs restroom flooded and the water came into the men‚Äôs. I had to walk in piss water after listening to some kid to coke in the restroom for like 3 minutes. The worst part is that the pizza sucked this time. The bread was so spongey and the cheese wasn‚Äôt cheesin. Sauce was ok. Idk man the service here just sucks.",

We also ordered some garlic cheese bread.\n\nOur cheese bread came out quickly and was hot, fresh, and tasty. Our pizza took time to cook, of course, and our waiter was good about communicating that. (I guess there are people that don't understand that it takes time to cook and prepare food?)\n\nThe pizza was piping hot and amazing. I think I enjoyed the sausage, green pepper, and onion slices more.\n\nWhile this was fantastic, it really is just a \"pan\" pizza - albeit a fine example. Other pizza places like Quattro's in Carbondale do nearly as good of a job with that same caramelized cheese crust.\n\nAll that said and done, will definitely be back when we are in town next!",

        "text": "I ate at Pequod's Pizza-Chicago around 3:30pm on Christmas Day. Pequod's GM, Sean Asbra, was working the front line at the host stand coordinating guest seating and all restaurant reservations were spoken for from 11am-9pm, But, Sean was able to find me the last spot remaining at the bustling bar. He was also busy directing to-go orders brought to the front, checking those orders and sending mistakes back to be fixed immediately, as well as tending to impatient awaiting holiday guests and interacting with his employees. Did I mention that four employees called in for their evening shift? The downstairs bar rail was closed at 5:30 due to lack of servers. How could the employees not respect their GM's work ethic? Impressive leadership! Rock star stuff.\n\nI was greeted by a sweetheart server - Jenny - that I noticed called all of her guests \"love.\" Nice touch. The bar rail was filled with guys watching football and a local regular introduced as Paul. Jenny knew her crowd and how to accommodate. This charm and knowledge has likely grown in Jenny's 10 years working at Pequod's. She was very prompt with drink inquiries and subsequent delivery, as well as meal inquiry. She also reminded me that once I ordered my pizza it would take about 40 minutes to arrive to my seat. I ordered my large pan pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and onion. It arrived much quicker - less than 30. In that time I had a nice conversation with Paul and Jenny about founder Burt Katz and the history of Pequod's. The signature caramelized crust. Burt being an intense guy of short stature that lost his daughter to cancer at a young age.  And some guests' time expectations for Pequod's more complicated pizza that takes time to make and bake.\n\nMy pizza arrived piping hot with a delicious aroma waffling off the well-constructed masterpiece. My server kindly offered to serve my first slice, a Pequod's tradition. However, I prefer to let deep dish pizza pizza rest, so when the slice is cut, the volcanic hot cheese and toppings don't slide off the sauce. That becomes a deconstructed lasagna. This pizza was out of this world! Perfect ratio of toppings, housemade hearty tomato sauce, and ohhhh that signature caramelized crust. That amazing caramelized crust - a layer of mozzarella cheese placed all the way around  the well-seasoned black cast iron pan between the housemade dough, forming a crispy and crunchy cheese wall. It was even more awesome than I had remembered!\n\nDo yourself a favor and eat your pizza at the restaurant. It makes a world of difference. Not that a boxed Pequod's pizza isn't delicious - IT IS - but you lose some magic when any pizza hits a box. The crisp. The box can can result in a soggy pizza if it sits too long. You can't blame the restaurant when you carry out or opt for delivery. This place is special! But...don't tell anyone else.  I want to be able to get a pizza next time I'm in town. :)\n\nGreat Christmas memory, Pequod's! Thanks! -- Chad",

        "text": "Hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I have tried Giordano and Lou Malnatis when I last visited Chicago and they come second and third to Pequods. I really liked the crust much more here and they give you so much toppings on your pizzas. Make a reservation ahead of time or else there‚Äôs going to be a wait.\n\nFood\nThere were a total of 4 adults and we shared two medium deep dish pizzas. We had 2 slices leftover afterwards and were stuffed. Pequods really throws on the toppings and so I really liked that about this place. It‚Äôs only about $3 per topping and you can choose which ones you want on top. The crust is nice because the outer edge is cooked to a crisp and the bottom side is still nicely cooked but not too hard to eat. The cheese is good and gooey and there isn‚Äôt too much that it just overpowers everything else. The sauce was delicious as well.\n\nAtmosphere\nI dined in and made a reservation in advance because the restaurant was so busy. It‚Äôs a nice place to hang out and get pizza with friends. Noise level is high with sports games going on the TV and lots of people inside. Relaxed vibe and low lighting.\n\nPricing\nThe prices for the pizza were reasonable I thought and were very filling for what we paid.\n\nService\nService was excellent and the staff were all courteous. Pizza took about a hour to come out which is normal for deep dish pizza.\n\nOther\nMake sure to have a reservation if you are dining in. There is a separate door just down the street a little if you ordered a pizza to go.",

        "text": "Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, commonly called Chicago Pizza for short, is a specialty food that cannot be missed when talking about Chicago. It is also famous as the eternal rival of New York pizza, which is closer to Italian style.\n\nIf I were to be honest, I personally prefer New York pizza, but I've never actually tasted proper Chicago pizza before. This is the pizza restaurant that I visited to experience the authentic taste since I was in the hometown.\n\nThe location is far from downtown, so it has a local flavor, and most importantly, it is not a franchise. If you have good accessibility and don't mind a franchise, you can go to Giordanos.\n\nWhile New York pizza places usually have an Italian feel, this place really reminds you of a shabby pub when you open the door. Even though it doesn't suit you, reservations are accepted and almost always recommended.\n\nI made a reservation in advance in Korea and was immediately guided to the second floor, and there was no single customer in sight except me. I was a little cringe-worthy because I was next to the big American brother and sisters, but I sat firmly.\n\nYou don't have to worry about whether you can eat an entire deep dish by yourself because the minimum size is 1 serving. I ordered a deep dish with added toppings and waited while drinking a glass of cold ale.\n\nThey said it would take about 40 minutes for the deep dish to come out, but it actually took less than that. I thought it was a small portion since it was for one person, but I was quite taken aback when I saw the size of the deep dish on the plate.\n\nThree toppings were added: pepperoni, Italian beef, and green pepper. Although it was a bit excessive, it was not a bad choice. If you don't add any toppings, the only ingredient is cheese.\n\nFirst of all, the taste was intuitive and simple, and as I heard, it was very heavy. Even leaving all the toppings aside, the amount of mozzarella cheese was almost pouring, so it filled my mouth.\n\nThis made me think that the dough would have to be thick, so it didn't feel too burdensome. It maintained a solid shape and supported the weight well, and the edges added crispness.\n\nThe pepperoni and Italian beef were, as expected, salty and fatty, but when they met the cheese and fell limply in the mouth, the harmony was truly amazing. Even though they were both obviously heavy, they seemed to be suppressing each other.\n\nThe bell peppers were roasted together in the oven as a last resort for balance, but they still had a slightly crunchy texture, making them a delicacy. It didn't stand out because I drank beer, but it did give me a sense of refreshment.\n\nSalt, pepper and a few spices are placed on the table so you can add them if necessary. At the last minute, I found myself choking on some red pepper seeds and putting them in my mouth even though I couldn't get any more.\n\nP.S. It doesn't seem that bad even without toppings.",

After ordering is a little unusual for a European: you choose the size of the pizza then the ingredients. The server was very friendly and patient with us! Lots of people, lots of noise but we were so well received that you forget it! So, nothing to do with an Italian pizza... it's definitely worth a try so to be sure of the quality and taste, it's better to trust the Chicagoans' choice.",

In particular, in the case of Giordano, several stores have been opened and it takes a lot of time as people flock there. On the other hand, there are some that maintain their own style and are popular among local people, and \"Pequos\" is one of them. There is also a bar, so it feels more like a pub than a pizza restaurant. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience Chicago pizza in a different way. And unlike other places, the edges are grilled crispy and slightly burnt.",

After us several more arrived and they had us all standing, some of them were already told that the wait to serve them was 40-50 minutes and they wouldn't let them take tables. The attitude of the receptionist is very bad, despotic and arrogant.\nThe plateau that we were on did serve us very well, everything was normal. Even a delegated slice that we ordered individually was offered to give us a double because the first one was a bit burnt.\nBut the main reason for the low rating was the taste of the Deep Dish Pizzas, they tasted like any other pizza from my city Tijuana, it was even tasteless.\nTwo days before we tried Giordanos and the next day we tried Lou Manatis and the flavors of these 2 chains seemed much better to the 3 of the group than this one from Pequods, I have seen reviews that rate Pequods as better but in our opinion the 2 most famous They are better.",

Wasn't it simpler and, above all, better treatment, for him to take the order, do his job and explain a little about the content of the letter?\nWell, after half an hour trying to decipher and finding out how we had to order the pizza, between doubt and doubt that we asked him, in the end, when it came to entering my information to register the order (which if you enter a telephone number from Spain , with a Spanish prefix and everything, it does not support it and it is a mandatory field ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) I also had a problem when entering the credit card information, it didn't like it either.\nAt this point, we have indicated that we would not take the card.

When ordering the pizza, which is what you go for, it is their main dish, it is the main one, it doesn't have many ready-made options, in fact I don't think it has any, you make it according to your taste, of course the more ingredients the more expensive, and to be able to try it we had to wait more than 1 hour for it! It's incredible, and it's also not that good, it's not bad but I don't understand why there are so many people and it takes so long to deliver it, I know that this style of pizza takes at least 20 minutes to cook, but more than 1 hour?!\n\nConclusion, I will not return to this place, it takes a long time to get you to the table, and it takes twice as long to deliver your pizza, which is not even that good, the service is bad, maybe this was my experience because I went on a Friday and at night but there is still no justification for you having to wait nearly 3 hours to eat. Maybe the only good point is that it is not expensive, just that. If you go to this place, arm yourself with patience and buckle up.",
